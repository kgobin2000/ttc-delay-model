# TTC Delay Model

## Overview

The TTC Delay Model is a data-driven project aimed at predicting subway delays using the 2023 TTC subway delay data. This project demonstrates proficiency in data science, machine learning, and neural network regression models. It consists of three main components: `data_cleaner.py` for data preprocessing, `train_model.py` for training the neural network model, and `predict_delay.py` for making predictions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: The `data_cleaner.py` script transforms raw TTC delay data into a clean, usable format for model training.
- **Model Training**: The `train_model.py` script uses a neural network regression approach to train the model on the 2023 TTC subway delay data.
- **Prediction**: The `predict_delay.py` script allows users to input new data and receive delay predictions.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- PyTorch (for neural network implementation)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Other relevant libraries and frameworks
